E3SMv1 (Cryosphere)
====================

The `E3SM version 1 cryosphere simulation campaign <https://e3sm.org/research/cryosphere-ocean/v1-cryosphere-ocean/>`_ includes standard set of 
Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (`CMIP6 <https://www.geosci-model-dev.net/9/1937/2016/>`_) 
Diagnosis, Evaluation, and Characterization of Klima (DECK) simulations. 
These E3SM simulations at standard resolution have been completed and the data is publicly available.

Data Resolution:

The standard resolution configuration of E3SM v1.0 water cycle configuration has approximate horizontal resolution of 
1 deg latitude by 1 deg longitude in atmosphere (110 km grid spacing), 
with ocean and sea ice grid of 60 km in the mid-latitudes and 30 km at the equator and poles, 
and river transport at 55 km horizontal resolution. 
This model configuration is described in  
`“v1 1 deg CMIP” <https://e3sm.org/model/scientifically-validated-configurations/v1-configurations/v1-1-deg-cmip6/>`_ page 
in `Scientifically Validated Configurations <https://e3sm.org/model/scientifically-validated-configurations/>`_.
