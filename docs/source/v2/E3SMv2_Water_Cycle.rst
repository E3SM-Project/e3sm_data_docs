E3SMv2 (Water Cycle)
====================

The simulation compaign for E3SMv2 (Water Cycle) was performed with two
separate model configurations:

* **v2.LR** (lower resolution)
* **v2.NARRM** (North America regionally refined model)

If you use data from this simulation campaign, please cite the relevant overview
manuscripts.
