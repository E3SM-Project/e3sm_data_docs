Simulation Data 
***************

The SCREAMv0 simulation data is available on **NERSC HPSS**.

**If you have an account on NERSC**, you can retrieve the data locally or remotely using Globus.

To download simulation data locally on a NERSC machine, refer to NERSC's documentation `here <https://docs.nersc.gov/filesystems/archive/#hsi-commands>`_.

**If you do not have access to NERSC**, you can download simulation data directly through the  NERSC HPSS
`web interface <https://portal.nersc.gov/archive/home/t/terai/www/SCREAM/SCREAMv0.SCREAM-DY2.ne1024pg2.20201127>`_.
Note that this will be slow given the large file sizes.

Original Run Scripts
*********************

Scripts originally used to run SCREAMv0 DYAMOND2 simulations are available `here <https://github.com/E3SM-Project/e3sm_data_docs/tree/main/run_scripts/SCREAMv0/original/>`_.

**Warning, these will not run out-of-the-box**.  They are provided to give guidance for setting up a similar run.
